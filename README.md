# Project-Investigate-the-Noshowappointments-Dataset

## Introduction
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.


### What to include in submission
A PDF or HTML file containing your analysis. This file should include:
A note specifying which dataset you analyzed
A statement of the question(s) you posed
A description of what you did to investigate those questions
Documentation of any data wrangling you did
Summary statistics and plots communicating your final results
Code you used to perform your analysis. If you used a Jupyter notebook, you can submit your .ipynb. Otherwise, you should submit the code separately in .py file(s).
A list of Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories, etc. that you referred to or used in creating your submission (add N/A if you did not use any such resources).
